-When using Apache Kafka, one concern raised is how to run unit tests for the producer without the need to start a whole kafka cluster and zookeeper.
-Hence, Mock Classes was added: MockProducer and MockConsumer
-A mock of the producer interface you can use for testing code that uses Kafka.
-By default this mock will synchronously complete each send call successfully. However, it can be configured to allow the user to control
the completion of the call and supply an optional error for the producer to throw.
